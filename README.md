# EDPA Fuel

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ae9e6bb3-b10d-4d28-8a1a-889f00f31f9c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/edpa/deploys)

The goal for EDPA’s talent website is, first and foremost, to showcase internships and entry-level opportunities to
young professional talent in Alabama and to generate applications for the EDPA’s first-ever Fuel Alabama Fellowship,
a supplemental internship program for the state’s best and brightest interns at compelling companies. This site will
highlight life and work opportunities in Alabama, inform students of the Fellowship, and offer other stakeholders
(economic developers, employers and universities) ways to get involved in the Fellowship and/or student retention
work in the future. 


We want at least 1,000 internship and/or entry-level opportunities highlighted on this platform; 20 Fellows
in Birmingham in the first year of the Fellowship’s operation, and a strongly diverse class of applicants and Fellows
from a variety of standpoints: companies, universities, ethnicities, genders, etc.
